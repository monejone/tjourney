		<h1><b>Notre-Dame de Paris</b></h1>
		<p>Notre-Dame de Paris (French: [nɔtʁə dam də paʁi] (About this sound listen); 
		meaning "Our Lady of Paris"), also known as Notre-Dame Cathedral or simply Notre-Dame, 
		is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, 
		France.[3] The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic 
		architecture, and it is among the largest and best-known church buildings in the Catholic Church 
		in France, and in the world. The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass serve to contrast 
		it with earlier Romanesque architecture.

		<h1><b>Eiffel Tower</b></h1>
		<p>The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] is a wrought iron 
		lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, 
		whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887–89 as the entrance to the 1889 
		World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals 
		for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable 
		structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 
		million people ascended it in 2015.

		<h1><b>Louvre Museum</b></h1>
		<p>The Louvre (US: /ˈluːv(rə)/),[1] or the Louvre Museum (French: Musée du Louvre [myze dy luvʁ] 
		(About this sound listen)), is the world's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. 
		A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st 
		arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are 
		exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet).[2] In 2017, the Louvre was 
		the world's most visited art museum, receiving 8.1 million visitors.[3]
